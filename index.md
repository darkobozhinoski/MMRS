We presented a collective adaptation process for Mobile Multi-Robot Systems that consists of two segments: first segment that focuses on adaptation triggered by mission problems and another segment that performs adaptation as a result of safety problems in the system. Here, we describe our evalaution of the approach. 
In the next section the experimental setup is described.

# Experiment Design

## GOAL

Analyze the Collective Adaptation Process (CAP) implementation for the purpose of evaluation  with respect to mission satisfiability, safety, and run-time efficiency 
from the point of view of researchers in the context of UAV-based missions

## Design
The experiment is designed as a multi-test within object study, because it is conducted on a single object (i.e., the current implementation of CAP) across a set of subjects (i.e., a set of UAV-based missions and a set of robotsâ€™ teams).

## Research questions

**RQ1**: To what extent does the CAP implementation achieves mission completion? [mission satisfiability]
_Used metrics_:
- Number of completed tasks

**RQ2**: To what extent does the CAP implementation preserve mission safety? [safety]
_Used metrics_:
- Number of collisions
- Number of collisions between agents
- Number of collisions between agents and obstacles

**RQ3**: What is the run-time efficiency of the CAP implementation? [efficiency]
_Used metrics_:
- memory consumption (bytes)
- CPU utilization (%)
- network traffic (number of packets)
- mission execution time (milliseconds)
